Relative Velocity Calculator

Task: Implement a program to calculate relative velocity in one dimension. Given the velocities of two objects, 
compute the relative velocity of one object with respect to the other.

Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
